## Overview

My MS2 project in my Code Institute course â€“ I wanted to take on an interactive game as my MS2 project as this seemed more interesting to me than other ideas that were suggested. I took on the memory game option and decided to base the theme on Succulents, a type of plant that I am passionate about.

The main goal of the game was to make this fully interactive and to provide different levels (more cards) in order to help improve someones memory whilst learning that Succulents come in all shapes, sizes and colors.

## UX (User Experience)

The user types for this website would be fans (old and new), key people within the music industry and the band themselves.  

### Visitor Stories
1. As a site visitor, I would like to have fun playing a simple memory game.
2. As a site visitor, I would like to have a brief overview of the rules before playing.
3. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to try a tutorial or demo before attempting a real game.
4. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to play different levels.
5. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to see how long each game took, how many moves were made and how accurate I was.
6. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to view the top scores/scorers on each level.
7. As a site visitor, I would like to log my top score with my name if I beat any 'top scores'.
8. As a site visitor, I would like an option to learn more about the subject matter of the game: Succulents.
9. As a site visitor, I would like a the game website to be easily navigable and have sleek design, that is responsive on different devices.
10. As a site visitor, I want the imagery and colors to be eye-catching that make me want to learn more about succulent plants.


### Business Stories
1. As a site owner, I have the same goals as the external users. I would like to make a game that I would enjoy playing.
2. As a site owner, I would like to make the game instructions simple to follow.
3. As a site owner, I would like to make the game logical to follow and interact with, even without reading the instructions prior.
3. As a site owner, I would like to provide a lot of interactivity within the game to provide information regarding the time taken, number of moves etc in order to produce 'top scores' and to provide a competitive element to the game.
4. As a site owner, I would like to share my passion for succulent plants as well as advice (separate to the game) on how to care for them.

## Structure

The memory game website is designed to be effective, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The simple navigation bar will be consistent across all pages.
    - The navigation links when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - The navigation link on the active page will provide a visual indication to the site visitors of what page they are currently viewing.
    - Buttons when hovered over and clicked will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - Consistent color scheme will be used throughout the site.
    - Links to external pages, if applicable, will open in a new tab so the user is not taken away from the game website.
- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized to consist of a home page and *** sub-pages. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for most user cases.
    - On each page there will be a consistent footer which will include:
        1. the creator of the game.
        2. 
    - Each page is clearly titled to make navigating the site clear and simple.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from left to right (navigation).

## Skeleton

The initial webpage layouts were sketched on the paper. The wireframes were then created in Balsamiq. Please view the wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile screens on the following pdf.

These initial wireframes included an additional page where I wanted to provide more information about Succulents, including a Google maps API for users to be able to find their nearest garden centre to look for these plants themselves. However I decided during development that this would be something to implement at a later date as I wanted to focus on the functionality of the game first and foremost.

## Design

### Color Scheme

- I want the color scheme to incorporate the colors of succulents. Whilst there are many various succulent colors, I decided on pastel shades of purple so that the colors aren't too bold and overtake the content. I offset this with a background image that had greens and subtle purple shades in it to compliment the color scheme.
- I wanted the color scheme to be calming and aid learning as well as memory improvement.
- I decided to use monochromatic shades but broke this up with the main succulent image as the image backdrop as well as on the back face of the playing cards to continue the theme.
- According to this website by [BournCreative](https://www.bourncreative.com/meaning-of-the-color-purple/#:~:text=Purple%20combines%20the%20calm%20stability,mystery%2C%20independence%2C%20and%20magic.) there are various different associations/meanings to the color purple.
    - "Purple combines the calm stability of blue and the fierce energy of red. The color purple is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition."
    - "The color purple is a rare occurring color in nature and as a result is often seen as having sacred meaning."
    - "The color purple has a variety of effects on the mind and body, including uplifting spirits, calming the mind and nerves."
    - "The color purple can boost imagination and creativity."

### Fonts

- I used teo fonts throughout the project, Lobster and Montserrat. 
    - Lobster is a cursive font, which I have used for all the headings and 'Succulent Match' brand/logo. I wanted a font that would stand out against the image background and give a sense of luxury as well as whimsy.
    - Montserrat is more basic font and was used for all paragraphs and for any information that needed to be clearly readable.
- Both fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Imagery

- For the images, I wanted to chose impactful images of Succulents to show off how diverse they can be in color, size, shape in their varieties.
- For the main image used as the background for the site and for the back face of the game cards I used a photo by [Maureen Bekker](https://www.pexels.com/@maureen-piecesphotography) from the [Pexels website](https://www.pexels.com/)

### Audio

- I wanted an audio sound to congratulate the user when they had completed a level. I used a round of applause sound from [free sounds library](https://www.freesoundslibrary.com/small-crowd-clapping/)

## Features

Succulent Match is built so that it is responsive and can be used on various devices/screens sizes, however for the best performance with the game I would recommend using the website on tablet ** device sizes upwards.
When it comes to adding more cards on the harder levels, it may prove tricky to be able to complete the challenge on a mobile due to the number of cards being able to fit on the screen and having to scroll to see others.

The website consists of 2 pages: 'Home/About' (landing) page and the 'Game' page itself.

### Current Features
- Navigation bar (on both pages):
    - an easy way to navigate through the website to specific sections of the website.
    - it is fully responsive and it collapses to navbar-toggler-icon (hamburger menu) on medium and small devices.
- Responsive
    - Drop-down navbar on medium and small devices.
    - Size and layout differences to be more aesthetically pleasing on medium and small devices, which is discussed in the specific pages below.
- Home page 
    - Brief introduction to the user about the game and my project.
    - How to play instructions
    - Small demo/tutorial to aid users to learn how to play the game.
- Game page
    - The buttons for difficulty levels are responsive.
    - The difficulty levels can be clicked and changed at any time to bring up a new game with the cards re-shuffled.
    - The cards are in a responsive grid layout: the card size as well as number of columns of cards in the grid change depending on what device is being used at the time.
    - The four game information stats are also responsive, to allow them to be easily read by the user.
    - Only 2 cards can be clicked at any one time, the board is locked to prevent a 3rd card being clicked before the game checks whether the cards match or not.
    - The same card cannot also be clicked twice, a unique card must be selected as the second card.
    - Game information section calculates:
        - the number of moves made.
        - the number of correct matches made.
        - the number of incorrect matches made.
        - the % accuracy in the game.
    - When the game has been complete a 'Congratualtions' message will apppear and will provide the user with their stats.
    - Top Scores **


### Future Implemenatation

- A 3rd page as per initial Wireframe as a space to give more information about Succulents, including:
    - More specified information of the different succulent varieties, especially those used in the game.
    - General care tips and advice for novice plant owners.
    - A google maps API to allow the user to search their local area for stockists and garden centres.
