## UX (User Experience)

The user types for this website would be fans (old and new), key people within the music industry and the band themselves.  

### Visitor Stories
1. As a site visitor, I would like to have fun playing a simple memory game.
2. As a site visitor, I would like to have a brief overview of the rules before playing.
3. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to play different levels.
4. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to see how long each game took and how many moves were made.
5. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to view the top scores/scorers on each level.
6. As a site visitor, I would like to log my top score with my name if I beat any 'top scores'.
7. As a site visitor, I would like an option to learn more about the subject matter of the game: Succulents.
8. As a site visitor, I would like a the game website to be easily navigable and have sleek design, that is responsive on different devices.
9. As a site visitor, I want the imagery and colors to be eye-catching that make me want to learn more about succulent plants.


### Business Stories
1. As a site owner, I have the same goals as the external users. I would like to make a game that I would enjoy playing.
2. As a site owner, I would like to make the game instructions simple to follow.
3. As a site owner, I would like to make the game logical to follow and interact with, even without reading the instructions prior.
3. As a site owner, I would like to provide a lot of interactivity within the game to provide information regarding the time taken, number of moves etc in order to produce 'top scores' and to provide a competitive element to the game.
4. As a site owner, I would like to share my passion for succulent plants as well as advice (separate to the game) on how to care for them.
5. As a site owner, I would like to provide a google map service so users can look up their local garden centre/succulent stockist.

## Structure

The memory game website is designed to be effective, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The simple navigation bar will be consistent across all pages.
    - The navigation links when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - The navigation link on the active page will provide a visual indication to the site visitors of what page they are currently viewing.
    - Buttons when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - Consistent color scheme will be used throughout the site.
    - Links to external pages will open in a new tab so the user is not taken away from the game website.
- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized to consist of a home page and *** sub-pages. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for most user cases.
    - On each page there will be a consistent footer which will include:
        1. the creator of the game.
        2. 
    - Each page is clearly titled to make navigating the site clear and simple.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from left to right (navigation).

## Design

### Color Scheme

- I want the color scheme to incorporate the colors of succulents. Whilst there are many various succulent colors, I decided on pastel shades of green and purple so that the colors aren't too bold and overtake the content.
- The color scheme of the cards involved with the game will have colors/designs on the back of the card the same to aid with the game play.
