## Overview

My MS2 project in my Code Institute course –

## UX (User Experience)

The user types for this website would be fans (old and new), key people within the music industry and the band themselves.

## Structure

The memory game website is designed to be effective, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The simple navigation bar with the band’s logo as the brand will make the website look simple and attractive.
    - The navigation links when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - The navigation link on the active page will provide a visual indication to the site visitors of what page they are currently viewing.
    - Buttons when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - Consistent color scheme will be used to let visitors focus on the band’s logo and brand. The ‘hero image’ on the main page will be chosen based on how it fits in with this color scheme also.
    - Links to external pages will open in a new tab so the user is not taken away from the band website.
- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized to consist of a home page and three sub-pages. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for most user cases.
    - On each page there will be a consistent footer which will include:
        1. navigation links to external social media and music streaming pages.
        2.	Navigation link to the contact page, creating visual reminders to book the band or ask for more information
    - Each page is clearly titled to make navigating the site clear and simple.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from left to right (navigation).
